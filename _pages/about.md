Hi! I'm Greg Xie, a roboticist at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute. I'm interested in how the design of robotic manipulators can reduce the complexity of planning and perception algorithms.

I completed my Masters at MIT with Daniela Rus, where I developed two mechanically intelligent end effectors. Before that, I completed undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering and EECS at MIT.
