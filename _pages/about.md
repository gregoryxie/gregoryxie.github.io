Hi! I'm Greg Xie, a roboticist at the Robotics and AI Institute (fka The AI Institute, the Boston Dynamics AI Institute) where I work on hand and wrist design for high performance manipulators.

I completed my Masters at MIT with Daniela Rus. Before that, I completed undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering and EECS at MIT.
